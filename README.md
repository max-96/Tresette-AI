# Providing an AI for the Game of Tresette

In our work we want to provide an AI capable of playing the Game of Tresette.
We are not aware of other attempts to develop skilled AIs for this game.

## Our Techniques

We plan to use determinization in order to apply common Full Information Game Algorithms
such as **Alpha-Beta** and **Monte Carlo Tree Search**.
At the moment, the determinization follows a common **Flat Monte Carlo** policy. 

Other than that, we want to use the **Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search** (Single Observer variant), that does not utilize determinization.
